In order to run this program, use a Java editor such as Dr.Java, which is what I used to make this project, or Jcreator.
Then create a blank space for the MathGame class, by copying everything under the "========" and above where it says 
DrawingPanel class. Then create a second blank one for the DrawingPanel class and copy paste everything under the 
"========" on to the blank space. The file names for both the classes have to be the same as "MathGame" or "DrawingPanel".
Then click on compile or build, whether you're using Dr.Java or Jcreator respectively or another Java editor. Then click 
on run for the program to start.
